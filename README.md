This repository is intended to provide reproducible code for the statistical methods and analyses presented in the Simulation Study. It includes all necessary scripts and files to replicate the results.


To get started with the code, you will need to have the following software and packages installed:

- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (specify the version, e.g., R 4.4.2)
- Required packages:
  - `R2OpenBUGS`
  - `coda`
  - `mvtnorm`
  - `parallel`
  - `statmod`
  - `ggplot2`

- [Rstudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) (specify the version, e.g., Rstudio 2024.12.0+467)
